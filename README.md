<h1 align="center">EdgeTech-S3-Uploader</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This repo builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-core">IQT Labs EdgeTech-Core</a> functionality to instantiate an <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.mosquitto">MQTT</a> client uploads all the files saved by the <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-filesaver">edgetech-filesaver</a>. Functionality is also included to respond to a <a href="https://github.com/IQTLabs/edgetech-c2">Command and Control</a> module to trigger the upload. All of this functionality is wrapped in a Docker container for cross-platform compatibility.

### Built With

[![Python][Python]][Python-url]
[![Poetry][Poetry]][Poetry-url]
[![Docker][Docker]][Docker-url]

## Getting Started

To run this repo, simply run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The s3-uploader is containerized and dependencies are managed using [poetry]("https://python-poetry.org"). 

### Prerequisites

Running this repo requires that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. 

## Usage

Spinning up this system requires an MQTT server and this container to be included in your `docker-compose.yml`. You can find an example of this workflow in this repository's `docker-compose.yml`. Additionally, some editing of relevant environment variables will be required based upon your system's configuration of topics to subscribe to and MQTT configuration. Examples of these environment variables can be found in this repository's `.env` file. 

Copying the s3-uploader `docker-compose` statements into a master `docker-compose.yml` and  `.env` files with your entire system of containers is the preferred workflow. Find an application architecture diagram example of how the usage of this module was envisioned below.
